### Creating a Pull Request

This book has been designed so that people can easily expand it.
To request us to review changes that you create, you will need to create a pull request.
Creating a pull request is described in
 [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

### File Location/Types

### [`ebook`](./ebook)

This directory holds all of the translations of the eBook.

### [`ebook/{LANG}`](./ebook/{LANG})

In the `ebook` directory we have the translations of the eBook in different languages.

If you are adding a new translation, make sure to make a copy of the `./ebook/en` directory and use the language code as the new directory name.

### [`ebook/{LANG}/content`](./ebook/{LANG}/content)

All the Markdown files for the 'Introduction to Bash Scripting' guide are located within the [`content`](./content) directory for the specific language.

For example if you are adding a Bulgarian translation copy the `./ebook/en` folder to `./ebook/bg`, translate the `.md` files in the `content` directory and submit a PR.

### PDF Generation

The project uses [Ibis](https://github.com/themsaid/ibis/) developed by [Mohamed Said](https://github.com/themsaid).
