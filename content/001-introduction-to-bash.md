# Introduction to Bash scripting

Welcome to this Bash basics training guide! In this **bash crash course**, you will learn the **Bash basics** so you could start writing your own Bash scripts and automate your daily tasks.

Bash is a Unix shell and command language. It is widely available on various operating systems, and it is also the default command interpreter on most Linux systems.

Bash stands for Bourne-Again SHell. As with other shells, you can use Bash interactively directly in your terminal, and also, you can use Bash like any other programming language to write scripts. This book will help you learn the basics of Bash scripting including Bash Variables, User Input, Comments, Arguments, Arrays, Conditional Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Debugging, and testing.

In order to write Bash scripts, you just need a UNIX terminal and a text editor like Sublime Text, VS Code, or a terminal-based editor like vim or nano.
